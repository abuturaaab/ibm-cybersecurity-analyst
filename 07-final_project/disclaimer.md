Dear Stranger;
I would like to thank you for taking an interest in my project, which I have shared on GitHub as a part of my specialization course. While I am happy to share my work with others, I would like to emphasize that this project is the result of my own hard work and effort, and I would like it to be used solely for the purpose of reference and inspiration.

Therefore, I strongly advise against any unethical use of my project, such as submitting it as your own work or copying parts of it to gain easy grades. Plagiarism is a serious offense that can result in severe consequences, including academic penalties and legal action.

I would like to remind you that the purpose of sharing my project is to showcase my skills and knowledge in a specific subject area. I encourage you to use it as a reference to understand the concepts and techniques used, but not to copy it verbatim or use it in any unethical manner.

In conclusion, I ask you to respect my work and use it ethically. Please do not plagiarize or copy my project, but rather use it as a source of inspiration to create your own unique and original work.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Best regards,
**AbuTurab**
