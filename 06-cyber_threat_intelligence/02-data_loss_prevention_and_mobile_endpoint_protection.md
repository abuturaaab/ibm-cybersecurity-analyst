# Data Security and Protection

## What is Data Security and Protection?

Protecting the:
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability

Of Data:
- In transit
- At rest
	- Databases
	- Unstructured Data (files)
	- On endpoints

### What are we protecting against?

**Deliberate attack:**
- Hackers
- Denial of Service

**Inadvertent attacks:**
- Operator error
- Natural disaster
- Component failure

## Data Security Top Challenges

- Explosive data growth
- New privacy regulations (GDPR, Brazil’s LGPD etc.)
- Operational complexity
- Cybersecurity skills shortage

## Data Security Common Pitfalls

Five epic fails in Data Security:
- Failure to move beyond compliance
- Failure to recognize the need for centralized data security
- Failure to define who owns the responsibility for the data itself
- Failure to address known vulnerabilities
- Failure to prioritize and leverage data activity monitoring

## Industry Specific Data Security Challenges

### Healthcare

- Process and store combination of personal health information and payment card data.
- Subject to strict data privacy regulations such as HIPAA.
- May also be subject to financial standards and regulations.
- Highest cost per breach record.
- Data security critical for both business and regulatory compliance.

### Transportation

- Critical part of national infrastructure
- Combines financially sensitive information and personal identification
- Relies on distributed IT infrastructure and third party vendors

### Financial industries and insurance

- Most targeted industry: 19% of cyberattacks in 2018
- Strong financial motivation for both external and internal attacks
- Numerous industry-specific regulations require complex compliance measures

### Retail

- Among the most highly targeted groups for data breaches
- Large number of access points in retail data lifecycle
- Customers and associates access and share sensitive data in physical outlets, online, mobile applications

## Capabilities of Data Protection

**The Top 12 critical data protection capabilities:**
1) Data Discovery
	- Where sensitive data resides
	- Cross-silo, centralized efforts
2) Data Classification
	- Parse discovered data sources to determine the kind of data
3) Vulnerability Assessment
	- Determine areas of weakness
	- Iterative process
4) Data Risk analysis
	- Identify data sources with the greatest risk exposure or audit failure and help prioritize where to focus first
	- Build on classification and vulnerability assessment
5) Data and file activity monitoring
	- Capture and record real-time data access activity
	- Centralized policies
	- Resource intensive
6) Real-time Alerting
7) Blocking Masking, and Quarantining
	- Obscure data and/or blocking further action by risky users when activities deviate from regular baseline or pre-defined policies
	- Provide only level of access to data necessary
8) Active Analytics
	- Capture insight into key threats such as, SQL injections, malicious stored procedures, DoS, Data leakage, Account takeover, data tampering, schema tampering etc
	- Develop recommendations for actions to reduce risk
9) Encryption
10) Tokenization
	- A special type of format-preserving encryption that substitutes sensitive data with a token, which can be mapped to the original value
11) Key Management
	- Securely distribute keys across complex encryption landscape
	- Centralize key management
	- Enable organized, secure key management that keeps data private and compliant
12) Automated Compliance Report
	- Pre-built capabilities mapped to specific regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, CCPA and so on
	- Includes:
		- Audit workflows to streamline approval processes
		- Out-of-the-box reports
		- Pre-built classification patterns for regulated data
		- Tamper-proof audit repository
